# Sample Blog Post

This is a sample blog post that demonstrates the capabilities of MDX with Next.js. You can write your posts in Markdown and include React components when needed.

## Code Examples

Here's a code example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Styling

You can use **bold text**, *italics*, and create lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Images

You can include images from your public directory:

```markdown
![Sample Image](/sample-image.jpg)
```

## Math Equations

You can include math equations using LaTeX syntax:

\[
E = mc^2
\]

## Next Steps

1. Create new `.mdx` files in the `/app/blog` directory
2. Add your content using Markdown
3. Include code snippets, images, and math equations as needed
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

That's it! You're ready to start writing your own blog posts.
