# Claude's Implementation of the Dominion Board Game

This is playable implementation of the classic Dominion deck-building game, built with React and TypeScript with Claude Code. The game supports 2 players and includes the core mechanics from the original game. Please see my [other post for the rationale and process for building the game](). This is intended mostly as a proof-of-concept. Please check out [this website](https://dominion.games/) for a fully supported version of the game from the publishers.

## How to Play

Dominion is a deck-building game where players start with identical decks and purchase cards from a shared supply to build unique strategies. Each turn consists of three phases:

1. **Action Phase**: Play one Action card (if you have one and choose to)
2. **Buy Phase**: Play Treasure cards and buy one card from the supply
3. **Clean-up Phase**: Discard all cards and draw a new hand of 5 cards

The game ends when 3 supply piles are empty or the Province pile is empty. The player with the most Victory Points wins!

## Game Implementation

The game below includes:
- All basic cards (Copper, Silver, Gold, Estate, Duchy, Province, Curse)
- The Kingdom cards from the base set
- Full turn management and game state tracking
- Automatic deck shuffling and card drawing
- Victory point calculation and game end detection

## Bugs

There are likely a number of bugs in the game.

- Moneylender forces copper trash
- Merchant doesn't apply silver effect 
- Artisan doesn't seem to put the card directly into hand
- Throne room pulls a popup but doesn't seem to correctly trigger the card twice or put it in play
- Moat reaction to block actions doesn't work
